In order to get the data into your notebook, you must do the following.
1. go to https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/unsw-canberra-cyber/cybersecurity/ADFA-NB15-Datasets/
2. Save the features file.
3. Save the four csv files of 2.5 million records
4. Compress the four csv files into a tar.gz file (I used 7Zip).
The resulting file should be 117MB.
The _data_load notebook is only for loading data if you want to do something yourself.
Otherwise you can load the data into the _neural_net notebook if you want to replicate what I have done.
